## Required Software/Tools

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

## To Load This Jupyter Notebook Project

1. Download the sources codes
   ![Github Download](./images/github-download.png)
2. Unzip the project source codes
3. Open command line interface

- For Windows, open **Apps -> Anaconda -> Anaconda PowerShell Prompt**
  ![PowerShell](./images/anaconda-powershell.png)
- For Mac, open **Terminal** (you can use Spotlight to search Terminal app)
  ![Mac Terminal](./images/mac-terminal.png)

4. In the command line interface, type the following command to verify your anaconda installation

   ```
   python --version
   conda --version
   ```

   You should see outputs like below
   ![python version](./images/python-version.png)

5. In command line interface, type `cd`+`SPACE`
6. drag the folder that contains your downloaded source codes from Github. (this will copy the file path of the source codes. It's usually very long path name and that's why we drag it to copy the path name instead of type it by our own). In your terminal, the command should looks like below. `cd` stands for **change directory**

   `cd C:\Users\sunnyng\Downloads\pdp-python-inter-main`

7. Press `ENTER` to confirm changing working directory to your project.
8. Type `pwd` (present working directory) to double check if you are already in the project directory.
9. type `jupyter notebook` to start jupyter notebook server from current working directory. A browser will automatically open up showing the Jupyter Notebook dashboard like below.

10. Double-click at a notebook (files with extension **.ipynb**) to start learning and practicing python.
